//! The Ziqpu loading indicator — a stand of wheat, drawn in SVG + animated in CSS (no runtime
//! dependency, works offline). Two beats, chosen by the owner over four other styles:
//!
//! - **Download** ([`WheatPhase::Download`]) — stalks grow in **left → right**, tracking the real
//!   percent; a grown stalk turns gold.
//! - **Loading into VRAM** ([`WheatPhase::Loading`]) — the whole field **sways** and its color washes
//!   **red → green → gold** (the "working" beat; gold is reserved for done).
//! - **Done** ([`WheatPhase::Done`]) — every stalk solid gold, still. Gold = resident in VRAM.
//!
//! The animation is pure CSS keyed off the container class (`.wload--loading` / `.wload--done`); this
//! component only decides how many stalks are grown (for the download percent) and the stagger delay.
